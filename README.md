# Intro

This project was bootstrapped by using Create React App as a base template removing some modules for visibility.

The project was built to fill in a TFL API test with the base requirement to display the next trains due to arrive at Great Portland Street underground station.

As well as extra tasks such as :

- Display the trains by the platform they're arriving at
- Display the trains in order of which one is due next
- Have the output auto-update so it's always showing the latest information
